# Singly Linked List in C++

This is my first implementation of a **singly linked list** in C++.  
It‚Äôs a **menu-driven console program** that lets the user:

- Create nodes based on user input
- Insert a node:
  - At the start
  - At the end
  - After a given value
- Print the list:
  - All nodes
  - Till a specific index
  - Within a given index range
- Search for a value
- Delete a node
- Clean up memory before exit

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
This is my **first crude version** of linked list implementation.  
I plan to refactor and improve it later (for example, by converting it into a `LinkedList` class).
